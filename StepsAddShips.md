Summary of the Steps to Add A Ship
----------------------------------

`Player.java`:
* Line 4: Add a value to `SHIP_LENGTHS` - doesn't matter what, make it a 4
  * (so it should look like: `{2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5}`)
* Line 5: Change `NUM_OF_SHIPS` to 6
* Line 13: Change conditional to 6
* Line 15: "Must be 5" becomes "Must be 6"
* Line 39: Counter should start at 6
